## Hello there, I’m Olle!

I'm a guy that likes to play computer games and also make them! 

#### Background

My interest in game development started at a young age when I started making my own maps for games my friends and I played. In later years I decided to pursue a career in game development and began to study game programming at Södertörns Högskola followed by The Game Assembly Stockholm. In my last year at The Game Assembly I got the opportunity to be an intern at King where my main responsibilities was to maintain and develop features for King's proprietary game engine, more specifically the editor. 

#### Personal interests

In my free time I like to play computer games. Lately there has been a lot of World of Warcraft and Old School Runescape (no exp waste) but I also enjoy more story driven games! 
I also like to play on my electric bass and listen to music, a lot... Some of my favorite bands are Opeth, Faith no More,  Red Hot Chili Peppers, Muse and K0rn to name a few.
