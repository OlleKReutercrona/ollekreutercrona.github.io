## Hello there, I’m Olle!

My interest in making games started at an early age when I started making maps for Counter Strike: Source in Valves editor Hammer. Since then, I’ve had a dream of one day having a career in game development. After a rather long career in retail I decided that I was ready to persue my dream and applied to Södertörns Högskola where I studied Game Design and Scripting.

Although the education at Södertörn taught me a lot about game development, I wanted something with a higher tempo and found The Game Assembly. Ever since fall 2022 I’ve been a student at The Game Assembly studying Game Programming, learning about game development in C++ and what it takes to work closely with other disciplines towards a common goal. I also got the amazing opportunity to create my own custom built game engine together with my team during my second year.

In a team I would describe myself as a happy guy that likes to increase morale and mood by cracking jokes and hyping my teammates up. I see myself as a driven, dependable teammate that has a clear understanding of what needs to be done and not afraid to step out of my comfort zone to try something new. I thrive when I work closely with colleagues that share my passion.
